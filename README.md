# SISYPHUS
SISYPHUS (Severely Impractical Scheduler You Predictably Hate but Ultimately Survive)
is my attempt at a custom task scheduler and day planner.

## Features

- Task scheduling (probably)
- Day planning (in theory)
- Existential crisis management (results may vary)

## Running the App
If you feel undeterred by the name and still want to try it out:

### Prerequisites

- npm installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pjasinski990/SISYPHUS-frontend.git
   cd SISYPHUS-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   nvm use
   npm install
   ```

### Running

1. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The app will run on port `3000` by default.

3. Before connecting, make sure to start the backend. Follow the instructions in the [backend repository](https://github.com/pjasinski990/SISYPHUS-backend).

4. Once both frontend and backend are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
